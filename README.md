# numerical-tic-tac-toe
A RL agent that learns to play Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe with odd numbers (the agent will always make the first move). Agent is trained using Q-Learning. The environment is playing randomly with the agent, i.e. its strategy is to put an even number randomly in an empty cell. If agent wins the game, it gets 10 points, if the environment wins, the agent loses 10 points. And if the game ends in a draw, it gets 0. Also, the agent should win in as few moves as possible, so for each move, it gets a -1 point.
